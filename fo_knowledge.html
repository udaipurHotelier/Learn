		<h6>Significance of The Front Office Department</h6>
			<p><b>The front office department of the hotel has a special responsibility when it comes to creating the ideal guest experience. It is often seen as the hotel’s face. Performing smooth check-ins, handling queries in a prompt and helpful manner,
			and responding speedily to resolve any problems will all go a long way to making a guest’s experience more enjoyable and positive. <br>
			As you can see, your front office department plays a key role in creating a good impression. Hotel trends might change, but a hotel’s front office must always maintain smooth and friendly interactions with customers.	</b></p>
			<p><b>The front office is the part of a company that deals directly with customers, and is often the first place customers interact with the business. Front office operations include customer service, marketing, sales, and advisory roles.
			<br>the front office is the reception and sales area of the business for many firms. Front-office employees in the financial services industry are typically those experts who generate revenue for the company by providing direct client services such as wealth management.</b></p>

				<p id="spara-1" class="paragraph">An occupied room in a hotel is a room that has been assigned to a guest who has checked in and is currently registered to the room. No one else can use the room until the current guest leaves.</p>
				<p id="spara-2" class="paragraph">A complimentary room is a room or lodging that is provided to a guest at no cost or at a reduced price. The guest is not required to pay for any portion of the room's price.<br>Complimentary rooms can also include room upgrades, where a guest is moved to a better room than the one they booked. This may also include complimentary services or amenities associated with the upgraded room, such as restaurant access or luxury bathroom amenities.<br>Complimentary services are extra products or services that a hotel offers to create a unique experience for guests.</p>
				<p id="spara-3" class="paragraph">DND stands for "Do Not Disturb" and is a feature or status that hotel guests can use to indicate they don't want to be disturbed. Guests can activate DND by: 
				<br> 1. Hanging a sign: Guests can hang a DND sign on their door handle to tell staff not to enter or knock on the door. <br>
				2. Using an electronic switch: Guests can use an electronic switch inside their room to activate DND.<br>
				3. Using a smart control: Guests can use a smartphone, TV, or voice command to set DND status.<br>
				4. When DND is active, hotel staff are instructed not to enter the room unless the guest requests it in an emergency.</p>
				
				<p id="spara-4" class="paragraph"> In a hotel, a room that is "vacant and ready" means that it has been cleaned and inspected and is ready for a new guest:
				<br> 1. Vacant: The room is not assigned to anyone and the guest has checked out.<br>
				2. Ready: The room is available for a new guest.</p>
				
				<p id="spara-5" class="paragraph"> The room cannot be occupied due to maintenance, refurbishing, or extensive cleaning. </p>
				
				<p id="spara-6" class="paragraph">OOS is a room status used in hotels to temporarily block a room for maintenance or other reasons.
				<br> 1. Purpose - OOS is used to mark a room as unavailable for immediate assignment, such as for minor repairs or scheduled maintenance. It can also be used to block a floor or wing during low season or for cleaning.
				<br>2. Availability - OOS rooms are still included in the hotel's inventory and can be sold if needed. They won't appear in lists of vacant rooms when searching for rooms to allocate. 
				<br>3. Appearance - On a room rack, OOS rooms are usually indicated with a crossed out water drop icon.
				<br>4. Effect on hotel metrics - OOS rooms don't affect a hotel's occupancy, ADR, or RevPar because they're still considered available to be sold. </p>
				
				<p id="spara-7" class="paragraph">DNCO is a hotel room status code that stands for "did not check out".It means that a guest left the hotel without notifying the front office, but they have made arrangements to pay their bill. <br> The hotel's management will have information about when and how the guest will settle their account. Checking out of a hotel is the process of settling any bills, returning room keys, and formally leaving the hotel.<br> It's a good opportunity to leave a lasting impression on the hotel. Even though it might be inconvenient, checking out can help resolve any discrepancies on your bill and allow the hotel to prepare the room for the next guest.</p>
			
				<p id="spara-8" class="paragraph">CO is a hotel acronym that stands for "Check Out". It indicates that a guest has left the hotel after settling their bill and returning their room key.
				<br>Here are some things that happen during a hotel check-out:
				<br> 1. Prepare the bill: The front desk prepares the final bill before the guest checks out.
				<br> 2. Return the keys: The guest returns their room key to the front desk.
				<br> 3. Refund deposits: If there was a key deposit or other security deposit, the front desk refunds it.
				<br> 4. Ask for assistance: The front desk asks if the guest needs help with their luggage or transportation.
				<br> 5. Collect feedback: The front desk asks for feedback about the guest's stay and encourages them to leave a review. </p>
			
				<p id="spara-9" class="paragraph">LCO stands for late check-out, which is a hotel arrangement that allows a guest to leave later than the normal check-out time. A guest can request a late check-out when booking their stay or by calling the front desk before checking out. The hotel will grant a late check-out if the room is not needed by another guest.
				<br>If a late check-out is not possible, guests can:
				<br> 1. Store their bags: Most hotels will store luggage for guests to pick up after check-out.
				<br> 2. Keep their bags in the car: If the guest is renting a car, they can leave their luggage in the trunk.
				<br> 3. Use a luggage locker: If the hotel doesn't store bags, guests can look for a luggage locker in the city.
				</p>
				<p id="spara-10" class="paragraph">Early Check-In (ECI) is a hotel feature that allows guests to check in before the standard check-in time. Hotels can set up ECI as an add-on item that guests can purchase. Here are some details about setting up ECI.</p>
				<p id="spara-11" class="paragraph">GUEST SETTED THE ROOM AMOUNT AND LEFT THE HOTEL , FRONT OFFICE HAS FAILED TO UPDATE THE ROOM STATUS.</p>
				<p id="spara-12" class="paragraph">VR : Vacant & Ready(Clean/ Available) - room is ready to be occupied.</p>
